# Hello, stranger !

Hi, My name is Dennis Riis.

I do software for a living. I am currently employed at Schibsted Denmark, in Ã…rhus, where I am the lead software architect - technically responsible for the technology, quality and code for the 3 main platforms offered by Schibsted in Denmark: DBA, Bilbasen and BilInfo. 

I still do a lot of coding in my day job; since that's important to keep a finger on the pulse in my role. This includes internal projects and the occasional open source contribution.

My weapons of choice professionally is C# on .NET Core and the occasional sprinkle of JavaScript; but in my spare time I also have fun with Go or Clojure.
Previously I have done a lot of different technologies, including Swift and Objective-C on the iOS platform.
